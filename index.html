									<h2>A City Above</h2>
									<p>‘A City Above’ represents a concept that elegantly shifts the notion of standard living, improving the speed and efficiency of Sydney’s rail network whilst simultaneously encouraging the nature of community and social interaction and also allowing for further housing space to be allocated. The concept was formed through analyzing my data set which demonstrated the distribution of transport use according to suburb, where problems and a solution was then constructed. </p>

									<p>Overpopulation is a current issue facing Sydney where the density of people in Sydney continue to increase as more people need to live close to the city resulting in more apartments block, i.e urban consolidation.</p>

									<h3>Raise It</h3>
									<div class="image main"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5kTDzoe.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>As the heading states… “raise it”. The solution to the abundance of problems is to simply raise the entire train network above ground, taking all train lines above ground, through simply creating incredibly large interconnected bridge system that spans across the original trainline and beyond. This system will also feature extensive cycling dedicated pathways that run along with the bridge system. New buildings and stations will be built at various intersections of the system, this will accomodate for living, work and socialising, ultimately encouraging the nature of interaction between various groups. <br>This system will reduce train delays by increasing the difficulty of non staff interference with the tracks, allow for more tracks to be built and increase the quantity of trains operating. It will ease the pressure of increasing population through reasons discussed previously but also through housing, as raising the track work above ground allows housing to be built below in this now open free space. An improved train system will encourage car only users to catch public transport, and ultimately reduce the congestion on Sydney roads. Finally employing a bike path within this system in such an efficient and effective way will provide great initiative to individuals considering cycling to work.</br> </p>

									<h3>Connection</h3>

									<p>These two images prefectly resemble the aesthetic ambition for this project, the strucutre represents geometry that is rigid, sporadic and distinguishable, yet it also portays an elegance that displays the direction and shape is intended to create, maintaining conception of connection.  </p>
									
									<h3>Concept Render</h3>

									<p>This concept represents the overall demonstration of shape and form, as displayed it represents the concept inspiration pictures, through using rigid linear geometry to create a branch or vein like structure. The solid black extrusion represents the bridge and track surface, the dashed line represents the pillars that support the structure and the white tall figures represent central hub towers to house accommodation, offices, shopping and major train station segments.  </p>
